  Ideally we'd want to update _mesh directly even if it already has an
  EquationSystems attached and doing work on it ... and that's thwarted by the
  problems:

  1. We can't easily tell if there's already an EquationSystems attached.
  2. We can't attach a second EquationSystems safely (if it already has a system 0)
     because the DoF indexing will need to be overwritten by our system.
  3. The destructor of es won't even clean up after itself (we generally expect
     a mesh to go unused after its EquationSystems is destroyed), much less know
     how to restore anything from a previous EquationSystems.

  To avoid these issues, we'll just construct a new DistributedMesh _mesh_copy
  from _mesh, then do the solve on _mesh_copy, then copy its node locations back
  to _mesh after the solve is done. That'll be slightly less memory-efficient
  and somewhat more CPU-efficient in the case where _mesh is serial, though
  it'll be significantly less memory-efficient when _mesh is already distributed,
  but either way the robustness is probably worth it.
